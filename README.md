###Introduction
Roomadillo is a revolutionary new iPhone app that makes finding college roommates easier than ever before. We all have or know someone who has had a bad roommate experience. The way roommates are chosen at all universities across the country is both arbitrary and compulsory. Students fill out a questionnaire that does not cover all bases and can be lied on, and then they are stuck with whatever roommate their university decides is best for them. With roomadillo, you can filter through potential roommates who have the ideal lifestyle for you. When you find someone you think you’d like to room with, simply swipe right on their profile! If you swipe right on each other you will receive their contact information and can decide in person whether they will be a good match.
### Functional Overview
Roomadillo is easy and fun to use. Sign in with facebook, fill out a few lifestyle questions, and then you’re ready to find the perfect roommate! The interface presents you with users and you can choose to add filters to make your search more precise. Swipe left on people you wouldn’t want to room with and right on those you would. When two people swipe right on each other, an alert will appear and the other person appears in your matches tab. Users can click on their matches to review their preferences or to contact them via text or call. Finally, users can also update their profile or logout at any time in the “More” tab.
